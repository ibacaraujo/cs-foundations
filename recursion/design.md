I found this so interesting that I wanted to add a text following the scripts. What am I talking
about? I am talking about the design of recursive algorihtms.

We have to think in the base case, always. Why always? Because we want the chain of recursive calls
to reach a finishing point to end the recursion. We have to begin testing some cases of this kind.

Then, we procede to think in terms of recur. Here we are going to perform one or more recursive
calls. This can involves several possible recursive calls. And, look, as we already defined our base
case, it is great to think in the recursive calls progression towards this base case.
